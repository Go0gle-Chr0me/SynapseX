## Nyot Wepowting Issues fow Shitnyapse / Cwashnyapse

**Onwy wepowt issues that can be wepwoduced and cweawwy, evidentwy expwainyed. Occasionyaw cwashes wewated to the nyatuwe of the softwawe that have nyo cweaw owigin wiww be cwosed and ignyowed. Titwes must be concise and pwovide a summawy of the cwash** ("Hewp cwash UwU  ^w^ " is nyot a good titwe, nyeithew is "Pwobwem UwU ". "Cwash when authenticating" ow "Invawid awgument Ewwow whiwe using syn.cache_invawidate" awe good exampwe of titwes.) We wiww awso cwose aww wepowts that pwovide nyo technyicaw infowmation. Fow youw wepowt to be accepted, you must specify at minyimum this infowmation:

    Youw opewating system (Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, etc.).
    Basic hawdwawe in fowmation (such as youw CPU, youw GPU, youw mothewboawd, etc.) If you don't knyow any of those ewements, we wecommend using the fwee vewsion of Speccy ow CPU-Z to wook up youw computew specifications.
    The scwipt you wan that cwashed the softwawe (Upwoad it to paste.sh ow hastebin), if appwicabwe. Pwease specify that the softwawe cwashed on its own if nyo scwipt was wan.
    The ciwcumstances of the cwash/bug/issue (fow exampwe, if the game cwashes unyiquewy when accessing a specific componyent/API/featuwe of the softwawe then you must nyame this componyent).
    Any additionyaw infowmation that you deem nyecessawy and usefuw.

If you awe a softwawe devewopew/wevewse enginyeew and you'we capabwe of pwoducing a .dmp fiwe fow us to anyawyze, then pwease do so and attach the fiwe to youw issue. It wiww be gweatwy appweciated. Othewwise, we wiww twy to do ouw best with the infowmation specified within the issue.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

**We consider security vulnerabilities to be a critical matter,** and we will **reward** those that report them to us in cash prizes and other goodies. If you find a potentially dangerous security vulnerability and you want to tell us then simply contact Louka at the e-mail address written on his [profile](https://github.com/LoukaMB) describing the issue. If further communication is needed from your part, it will be requested.

Those are security vulnerabilities that warrants a reward:
- Methods to use the software without owning a legitimate account
- Methods to circumvent the software's security mechanisms (packing, obfuscation, detection, etc.)
- Methods to infect a Software user via the usage of malicious Lua scripts
- Anything related to unauthorized interaction with our online API

Those are security vulnerabilities that, while important, are not critical enough to be considered rewardable:
- Ways to detect the software from a script within a game
- Modifying or intercepting Synapse web requests

## Other communications

If you have anything else to transmit to us, then either personally contact one of our developers via the e-mails on their profiles or communicate with them on the various Synapse chatrooms.
